======================
bund.de: Valid DNSSEC and TLSA (DANE-EE) Record with traditional pki certificate
bklosr.de: Valid DNSSEC and TLSA (DANE-EE) Record with traditional pki certificate
 from untrusted pki (CACert.org)


TODO:
======
- Rewrite TLSA Check, should give 3 return values:
   validated: Everything is ok.
   validation failed: No TLSA Record matches, but there are some...
   validation impossible: No TLSA Records or some implementation missing.
- Make the DNSSec values appear in the "more info" window for the page.
   https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.xul
- Distinguish between DNSSEC failures "IP" authenticated and certificate 
   authenticated. Example: example.com is signed. service.example.com is 
   a cname to server55.cloud.com. The tlsa record 
   _443._tcp.service.example.com is signed and can be validated with DNSSEC
   but the IP adress cannot be authenticated.
- Option to use system resolver with +ad flag? (No key material in extension...)
- Testsuite
   Explanation:
   - Secure: correctly signed
   - Insecure: not signed/authenticated
   - failed: should be signed but is not...
   - fits: fits certificate of ssl connection
   - ok, secure: mark the IP/Certificate as secure in the UI
   - ok: Do nothing. 
   - error: Warn user. Maybe forgery?
   States for IP Record:
   - existing, secure       -> ok, secure
   - existing, insecure     -> ok
   - existing, failed       -> error
   - not-existing, secure   -> ok
   - not-existing, insecure -> ok
   - not-existing, failed   -> error
   States for TLSA record:
   - existing, fits, secure         -> ok, secure
   - existing, fits, insecure       -> ok
   - existing, fits, failed         -> error
   - existing, not fitting, secure  -> error
   - existing, not fitting, insecure-> error
   - existing, not fitting, failed  -> error
   - not existing, secure           -> ok
   - not existing, insecure         -> ok
   - not existing, failed           -> error
   There are further cases when you look at the TLSA verification parameters.
   (PKIX-TA, PKIX-EE, DANE-TA, DANE-EE)
- Implement selector field "SPKI: Use subject public key"
   How to do that? Don't know howto get the data out of firefox.
   Implement own ASN.1 Parser for that field?

   

Thoughts:
==========
- Authentication of DNS-Names in certificates is possible without accessing
   the server. We may implement that part in some other UI (maybe inside the
   view certificate thing?) - doesn't work, we need port and proto -> page-info
- Howto display IP existing+secure, TLSA existing+fits+secure and 
   traditional pki secure? Special marking like EV? -or- reduce visibility of
   traditional pki lock icon (gray instead of green?)
- Should DANE replace traditional PKI? or complement it?
