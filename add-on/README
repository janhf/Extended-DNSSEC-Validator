bund.de: Valid DNSSEC and TLSA Record.

TODO:
======
- Rewrite TLSA Check, should give 3 return values:
   validated: Everything is ok.
   validation failed: No TLSA Record matches, but there are some...
   validation impossible: No TLSA Records or some implementation missing.
- Make the DNSSec values appear in the "more info" window for the page.
   https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/pageinfo/pageInfo.xul
- Distinguish between DNSSEC failures "IP" authenticated and certificate 
   authenticated. Example: example.com is signed. service.example.com is 
   a cname to server55.cloud.com. The tlsa record 
   _443._tcp.service.example.com is signed and can be validated with DNSSEC
   but the IP adress cannot be authenticated.
- Option to use system resolver with +ad flag? (No key material in extension...)
- Testsuite
   States for IP Record:
   - Secure (correctly signed)
   - Insecure (not signed/authenticated)
   - failed (should be signed but is not...)
   States for TLSA record:
   - existing, fits certificate of ssl connection, secure
   - existing, fits, insecure
   - existing, fits, failed
   - existing, not fitting, secure
   - existing, not fitting, insecure
   - existing, not fitting, failed
   - not existing, secure
   - not existing, insecure
   - not existing, failed
   
Thoughts:
==========
- Authentication of DNS-Names in certificates is possible without accessing
   the server. We may implement that part in some other UI (maybe inside the
   view certificate thing?) - doesn't work, we need port and proto -> page-info
